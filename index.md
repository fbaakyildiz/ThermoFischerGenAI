# ProcalysAI

[Back to Portfolio](https://fbaakyildiz.github.io/?skipIntro=1#projects)

Clinical decision-support prototype for procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship using structured test subject data, serial procalcitonin kinetics, and a hardened multi-agent LLM pipeline.

> Research use only. ProcalysAI is not a medical device and does not replace clinician judgment.

## What The Project Does

- Interprets procalcitonin thresholds for LRTI and sepsis workflows.
- Tracks serial procalcitonin values and calculates treatment-response decline.
- Flags Day 4 treatment-failure risk when procalcitonin decline is below the expected threshold.
- Applies clinical safety overrides for unstable or high-risk patients.
- Routes the case through four specialized agents: intake, clinical reasoning, kinetic context, and final report.
- Supports local use with Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and OpenRouter API keys.
- Returns structured stewardship reports with rationale, warnings, review flags, and telemetry.

## Why It Matters

Antibiotic stewardship decisions often require combining biomarker thresholds, clinical instability, patient risk, and serial response trends. ProcalysAI was built to test whether a structured multi-agent workflow can produce more transparent, auditable recommendations than a single general-purpose prompt.

The system emphasizes:

- structured JSON contracts
- prompt-injection protection
- deterministic safety flag preservation
- concise clinician-facing reports
- research-only local execution

## Run Locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open:

http://localhost:8000
```

The app asks for a model API key in the browser before analysis starts. The key is kept in browser memory for the current session and passed only to the local FastAPI backend.

# ProcalysAI

Clinical decision support prototype for **PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship** using structured patient inputs, serial procalcitonin kinetics, and a four-agent LLM reasoning pipeline.

[GitHub Pages project page](https://fbaakyildiz.github.io/BrahmsAI/)

> **Research only:** ProcalysAI is not a medical device and does not replace clinician judgment.

Project supervision: Claudia Steffen, Sr. Manager for Global Partner and Digital Development, PCT & Licensed Markers at Thermo Fisher Scientific. Contact: claudia.steffen@thermofisher.com.

## Highlights

- PCT threshold interpretation for LRTI and sepsis workflows.
- Serial PCT kinetic tracking with decline calculation and Day 4 treatment-failure alerting.
- Multi-agent pipeline: intake, clinical reasoning, kinetic/context analysis, and final report generation.
- Multi-provider model support for Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and OpenRouter.
- Prompt-injection controls on clinical notes and hardened system prompts.
- Structured JSON output validation, retry handling, timeouts, and pipeline telemetry.
- Local-first FastAPI app with a dependency-free single-file frontend.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

The UI asks for a model API key at startup. The key is kept in browser memory for the current session and sent to the local FastAPI backend for provider calls.

## Environment Fallback

For Gemini-only fallback without using the UI key gate:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set GEMINI_API_KEY
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Never commit real API keys, `.env` files, shell history with credentials, or credential-bearing Git remote URLs.

## Main API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `/` | `GET` | Serves the ProcalysAI frontend |
| `/api/validate-key` | `POST` | Detects and validates model provider access |
| `/api/analyze` | `POST` | Runs the stewardship pipeline |
| `/health` | `GET` | Process health check |

## Security Notes

ProcalysAI is currently designed as a local-first prototype.

Before deploying publicly:

- Restrict CORS to trusted origins.
- Add authentication and authorization.
- Use HTTPS.
- Avoid passing user API keys through an unauthenticated public backend.
- Review clinical data handling requirements for the target environment.
- Move deterministic clinical thresholds into tested backend code if using beyond research/demo workflows.
